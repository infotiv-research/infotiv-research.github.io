## ARTWORK​ (The smart and connected worker)
The goal of ArtWork is to develop a real-time, context-aware assistance system for workers. The solution will be a combination of hardware and software that will be demonstrated in four different industrial use cases in the domain of truck assembly, textile manufacturing, ship engine manufacturing, and bus assembly. The solution will comprise :

- digital Twins of factory workers and equipment​
- smart instruction generation​
- a worker feedback system.​

The goal is to connect workers to the production line and enable automatic derivation of process instructions based on the context​

## SMILE III, IV (Safety analysis and verification/validation of ML based systems)

- Future autonomous vehicles will rely on Deep machine learning algorithms (DML), whose correct behaviour cannot be guaranteed by traditional software engineering approaches ​
- SMILE III project tries to develop method(s) that allow DML-based functions to be included into safety critical vehicular applications with quality control requirements from industrial standards.​

## VALU3S (Verification and Validation of Automated Systems' Safety and Security​)

- VALU3S aims to design, implement and evaluate state-of-the-art V&V methods and tools​
- VALU3S brings together a consortium with partners from 10 different countries​
    - industrial partners (24 partners) from automotive, agriculture, railway, healthcare, aerospace and industrial automation and robotics domains ​
    - leading research institutes (6 partners) ​
    - universities (10 partners) ​
